  Day 15 of hashtag#100DaysOfCode – Today’s focus: console. Log () mastery in JavaScript!
🎯 What I’ve been mastering
🔹 Leveling Up in JavaScript – Exploring Variables & Operators.
🔹 Explored the console. log () works.
🚀 Variable declaration with var, let, and const, and understanding scope differences between them.
⚙️ Delved into operators:
Arithmetic (+, -, *, /, %, **) and unary (++, --, +, -) 
String concatenation using +
Comparison (==, ===, <, >, etc.) and logical (&&, ||, !) operators 
Ternary (? :) for concise conditional logic.
